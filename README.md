# Salary-Prediction-Hyperskill
This is "Salary Prediction" project form Hyperskill.<br>
Practice fitting linear models with scikit-learn to predict values on the unknown data. Apply polynomial feature engineering, test your data for multicollinearity, and evaluate models with the MAPE score.<br>
Linear regression is one of the simplest yet powerful tools for finding regularities in data and using them for prediction. It is widely applied both in science and practice. In this project, you will learn how to apply scikit-learn library to fit linear models, use them for prediction, compare the models, and select the best one. You will also learn how to carry out testing for certain issues with data.<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
